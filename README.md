This repository contains the code implementation for the paper

## 📙 Description
This project introduces a multilayer encryption framework that encrypts user prompts before sending them to cloud-based large language models (LLMs). The framework ensures that the data remains unintelligible to both human observers and the LLM, while preserving the original intent of the prompts and maintaining model performance.
